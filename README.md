# Neuro Python

## About

This repository contains a few scripts written for analyzing behavioral and EEG data using pandas (behavioral) and MNE (EEG). It also contains demo scripts for the psychophysics course I taught to students in the human neuroscience master's program at the University of Turku.

## Psychophysics Demos

- Single-subject and group-level analysis of reaction time (RT) data between two conditions.
- Single-subject and group-level analysis of the d' and criterion metrics from signal detection theory (SDT).
- Demo data used for the scripts.
- Exported data that can be used with the [SDT Kamu app](https://github.com/adam-herrala-bricker/SDT-buddy).
- PDFs of the instructions for context.

>[!NOTE]
>Keep in mind that these demo scripts were written as examples for students, so they're over-commented, less compact than they could be, and littered with `print()` statements.
